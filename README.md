In this course you are going to learn everything you need to get started using Adobe InDesign. 

This course is for beginners. You don’t need any previous knowledge in InDesign, graphic design, or desktop publishing. We’ll start right at the beginning, working our way through step by step.

Together, during our course, we’ll make a 4 page brochure learning the tools and techniques necessary to design it and print it professionally. We’ll work with color, picking our own and using corporate colors. We’ll explore how to choose and use fonts like a pro. We’ll find, resize and crop images. 

So, if you’ve never opened InDesign before, or you’ve opened it and struggled, join this course and I’ll show you the easy way to make beautiful design work in Adobe InDesign.
